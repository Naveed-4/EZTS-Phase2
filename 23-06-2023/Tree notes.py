#								TREE

# https://www.gatevidyalay.com/tree-data-structure-tree-terminology/

# To implement hierrachical data/information we use Tree DS
# In a tree every node can have any no. of children

#				Height of a node
# Look down count the levels

#				Depth of a node
# Look up count the levels

#If a parent is having two children. We call them as LEFT childe and RIGHT child

# A tree can be divide in two parts: LEFT subtree and RIGHT subtree

# NOTE: Whenever we perform ant opertaion in tree we do the LEFT subtree first then RIGHT subtree

# LEAF node: Node with NO Children

# DEGREE: SIZE-1
# SIZE : all no.of nodes
# Breadth : no.of leaf nodes

# Siblings:
# Makers:
# Neighbours: 
# SIZE:

#							TYPES OF TREE
# https://www.javatpoint.com/tree
# 1. Binary Tree
# 2. Binary Search Tree
# 		Complete Binary Tree : Except last level all levels must be filled
# 		Strict Binary Tree : 0 or 2 Child
# 		Perfect Binary Tree : all interor nodes have 2 child and leaf nodes at end same level
#		Binary tree
# A node can have Max 2 children
